       " {'context': \"Drosophila melanogaster has a single Adar gene encoding a protein related to mammalian ADAR2 that edits transcripts encoding glutamate receptor subunits. We describe the structure of the Drosophila Adar locus and use ModENCODE information to supplement published data on Adar gene transcription, and splicing. We discuss the roles of ADAR in Drosophila in terms of the two main types of RNA molecules edited and roles of ADARs as RNA-binding proteins. Site-specific RNA editing events in transcripts encoding ion channel subunits were initially found serendipitously and subsequent directed searches for editing sites and transcriptome sequencing have now led to 972 edited sites being identified in 597 transcripts. Four percent of D. melanogaster transcripts are site-specifically edited and these encode a wide range of largely membrane-associated proteins expressed particularly in CNS. Electrophysiological studies on the effects of specific RNA editing events on ion channel subunits do not suggest that loss of RNA editing events in ion channels consistently produce a particular outcome such as making Adar mutant neurons more excitable. This possibility would have been consistent with neurodegeneration seen in Adar mutant fly brains. A further set of ADAR targets are dsRNA intermediates in siRNA generation, derived from transposons and from structured RNA loci. Transcripts with convergent overlapping 3' ends are also edited and the first discovered instance of RNA editing in Drosophila, in the Rnp4F transcript, is an example. There is no evidence yet to show that Adar antagonizes RNA interference in Drosophila. Evidence has been obtained that catalytically inactive ADAR proteins exert effects on microRNA generation and RNA interference. Whether all effects of inactive ADARs are due to RNA-binding or to even further roles of these proteins remains to be determined.\",\n",

       " {'context': \"Kx is lacking in the RBCs of patients with the McLeod syndrome. This condition is sometimes associated with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). If given allogeneic RBCs, CGD patients with the McLeod phenotype may produce anti-Kx and anti-Km, and only phenotypically matched McLeod blood would be compatible. McLeod phenotype persons without CGD have made anti-Km but not anti-Kx (2 examples), and thus both McLeod and K(O) blood would be compatible. RBCs from a transfused patient with the McLeod phenotype but not with CGD (non-CGD McLeod) were typed for the Kell blood group antigens, and the plasma was analyzed for the presence of antibody by agglutination. The molecular basis was determined by analyzing for XK protein on RBC membranes by Western immunoblotting, by sequencing the XK gene, and by RFLP. The RBCs did not react with anti-Kx + anti-Km and showed weakening of Kell system antigens. The patient's plasma reacted moderately (2+) with RBCs of common Kell type and strongly (4+) with K(O) RBCs and RBCs of common Kell type treated with dithiothreitol, and did not react with McLeod RBCs. XK protein was absent from the RBC membranes. The XK gene had a point mutation in the donor splice site of intron 1 (G>C). This is the first report describing the molecular alteration in a non-CGD McLeod patient who has made anti-Kx. The immune response of people with the McLeod phenotype can vary, and K(O) blood may not always be compatible.\",\n",

Dasatinib has increased potency against ABL compared to the current therapy imatinib, and is effective in many cases where disease is resistant to imatinib. Dasatinib also inhibits many Src-family tyrosine kinases. We have demonstrated in this study that dasatinib is able to block the function of normal human T-lymphocytes in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations. T-cell functions including proliferation, activation and cytokine production were all uniformly inhibited in the presence of dasatinib. We also demonstrated inhibition of TCR signalling through Src-family kinase LCK, and predicted that inhibition of LCK and other kinases involved in T-cell signalling by dasatinib is responsible for the suppression of T-cell function. These findings raise the concern about potential T-cell inhibition in patients taking dasatinib, and suggest a possible application for the treatment of T-cell mediated immune disorders.',\n",

       " {'context': 'Mutations in solute carrier family 9 isoform 6 on chromosome Xq26.3 encoding sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6, a protein mainly expressed in early and recycling endosomes are known to cause a complex and slowly progressive degenerative human neurological disease. Three resulting phenotypes have so far been reported: an X-linked Angelman syndrome-like condition, Christianson syndrome and corticobasal degeneration with tau deposition, with each characterized by severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, autistic behaviour and ataxia. Hypothesizing that a sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 deficiency would most likely disrupt the endosomal-lysosomal system of neurons, we examined Slc9a6 knockout mice with tissue staining and related techniques commonly used to study lysosomal storage disorders. As a result, we found that sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 depletion leads to abnormal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside and unesterified cholesterol within late endosomes and lysosomes of neurons in selective brain regions, most notably the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala, the CA3 and CA4 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and some areas of cerebral cortex. In these select neuronal populations, histochemical staining for β-hexosaminidase activity, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of GM2 ganglioside, was undetectable. Neuroaxonal dystrophy similar to that observed in lysosomal disease was observed in the cerebellum and was accompanied by a marked and progressive loss of Purkinje cells, particularly in those lacking the expression of Zebrin II. On behavioural testing, Slc9a6 knockout mice displayed a discrete clinical phenotype attributable to motor hyperactivity and cerebellar dysfunction. Importantly, these findings show that sodium-hydrogen exchanger 6 loss of function in the Slc9a6-targeted mouse model leads to compromise of endosomal-lysosomal function similar to lysosomal disease and to conspicuous neuronal abnormalities in specific brain regions, which in concert could provide a unified explanation for the cellular and clinical phenotypes in humans with SLC9A6 mutations.',\n",
